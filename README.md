# Kunkun Component Library

This library contains components libraries for developing kunkun extensions.

**Supported Frameworks:**

- React
- Vue
- Svelte

To keep component style consistent across different frameworks, I used Shadcn (React) and its ported version for Vue and Svelte.

- https://www.shadcn-vue.com
- https://www.shadcn-svelte.com
- https://www.shadcn-ui.com

Shadcn requires users to install tons of customizable components to project, which is not necessary for kunkun extensions. So I created this library to provide a minimalistic version of Shadcn for kunkun extensions.

If you want to customize any components, you can always add shadcn components to your project the regular way and import components from these libraries if you just need the default style.
